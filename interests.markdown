My personal interests include cooking, gardening, [travelling](https://www.instagram.com/rohitkolora/) and scientific art.

<h3>Scientific art</h3>

![My image 1](../files/genomeinformatics_poster.jpg){: height="300" }{: style="float: center"}
<br>Cover art for GenomeInformatics at CSHL, 2017. The cover represents human chromosomes on a computer chip. 

![My image 2](../files/smbe2015_indels.jpg){: height="300" }{: style="float: center"}
<br>Presented at SMBE 2015, Orlando USA, 2018. The theme of this poster is small indels on the human lineage inferred using primate genomes and Archaic genomes. Here the leaves are indels and the different colours represent lineage specificity.

![My image 3](../files/defense_assembly_drawing.png){: width="300" }{: style="float: center"}
<br>Presented at my Defense, University of Leipzig, 2018. This theme is based on the idea of denovo assembly of the Neanderthal genome. Here is a representation of the Neanderthal skull being assembled as a puzzle where each piece is made of alphabets ( representing sequences). The process of solving the puzzle here indicates genome assembly.
