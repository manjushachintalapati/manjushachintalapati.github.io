My personal interests include cooking, gardening, travelling (PC Rohit Kolora) [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/rohitkolora/) and scientific art.

<h3>Scientific art</h3>

![My image 1](../files/genomeinformatics_poster.jpg){: height="300" }{: style="float: center"}
<br>Cover art for GenomeInformatics at CSHL, 2017. The cover represents human chromosomes on a computer chip.

<br>Presented at SMBE 2015, Orlando USA, 2018. Themes of poster is based on my paper on small indels on the human lineage inferred using primate genomes and Archaic genomes. Here the leaves represent indels and the different colours are lineage specific indels.

![My image 3](../files/defense_assembly_drawing.png){: width="300" }{: style="float: center"}
<br>Presented at my Defense, University of Leipzig, 2018. Themes of the poster is based on the idea of denovo assembly of the Nenadertrhal genome. This is a representation of the Neanderthal skull being assembled as a puzzel where each peice of the puzzel is made of alphabets ( representing sequences). The idea of solving the puzzel indicates genome assembly.
