I'm Manjusha (She/her), a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley studying human genetic and genomic diversity. My current [Research](/research/) focus is on analyzing human populations - including present day and ancient groups, and developing computational methods to better understand human diversity. <br>

I am a trained Bioinformatician with masters from [UOH](https://uohyd.ac.in/) and graduated with a Ph.D. in Informatics from [MPI EVA](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/), Germany in 2018. My focus in grad school was on genomic changes such as small- and large-scale genomic insertion deletions in humans. This included analysis of ancient DNA, applying comparative analysis and developing computational tools to analyze genomic data. In 2019, I moved to [Moorjani Lab](https://www.moorjanilab.org/) at UC Berkeley where I continued my research on human population genetics. I developed methods to infer demographic events such as timing of admixture as well worked on developing workflows to infer germline mutation rates. In addition to basic human genetics, my wider interests involve translational research such as leveraging genomics methods for phenotype and disease mapping. <br>
