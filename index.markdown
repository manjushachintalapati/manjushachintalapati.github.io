I'm Manjusha (She/her), a postdoctoral researcher at [Ancestry DNA](https://www.ancestry.com/) studying populaitons genetics using vast diverse population data. I was a former postdoc at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) studying human genetics and genomic diversity. My current [Research](/research/) focus is on analyzing human populations - including present day and ancient groups, and developing computational methods to better understand human diversity. <br>

I am a Bioinformatics researcher with a Masters from [UOH](https://uohyd.ac.in/) and an Informatics Ph.D. from [MPI EVA](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/), Germany in 2018. My focus in grad school was on genomic changes such as small- and large-scale indels in humans. This included analysis of ancient DNA, applying comparative methods and developing computational tools to analyze genomic data. In 2019, I moved to [Moorjani Lab](https://www.moorjanilab.org/) at UC Berkeley where I continued my research on human population genetics. I developed methods to infer demographic events such as timing of admixture and developed workflows to infer germline mutation rates. In addition to basic research, my scientific interests include translational projects including leveraging genomic data for phenotype and disease mapping. <br>
