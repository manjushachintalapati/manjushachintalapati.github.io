<br>Themes of my research include genomic analysis of ancient DNA, Bioinformatics pipeline building and computational method development with applications in population genetics. Here is a short [CV](../files/CV_ManjushaChintalapati_2023.pdf). <br> 

<h3>Genomic variation affecting genomic human diversity</h3>

My graduate work focused on non-SNP variation in humans which affect larger parts of the genome compared to SNPs and cause loss of function. My work on [indels on the human lineage](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1018-8) identified 2X occurrence of deletions compared to insertions with higher deleterious effects. Indels segregating in humans, specifically non-Africans introduced by introgression from Neanderthal admixture have undergone selection. In-silico functional analysis suggested introgressed indels linked to phenotypes such as Menarche in humans.

<h3>Evolutionary forces shaping diversity in humans</h3>

Mutations and recombinations are two major molecular processes impacting human genome diversity. Inference and understating the these processes is essential for better understanding the impact of human genetic variation. These rates can use as a clock to measure the time elapsed since an event has occurred helping us reconstruct events of the past. We developed [DATES](https://elifesciences.org/articles/77625) which uses recombination rate as a clock to date admixture times. DATES is a single sample statistic applicable to both present day and ancient (damaged/degraded) genomes. Applying DATES to European genomes helped infer the timing of formation of ancient Anatolian farmers and Steppe pastoralists, two of the major ancestral populations contributing ancestry to most present-day Europeans. The method is freely available as [DATES_v4010](https://github.com/manjushachintalapati/DATES_v4010).

Study of mutation rates across the primate tree including the humans, great apes, new world and old world monkeys using published studies revealed 4X variation in the mutation rate across the phylogenetic tree. In our [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X20300794) we show discrepancies between the genetic and fossil evidence changes our understanding of human evolution. Potential explanations of this effect could be either due to life history traits, slowdown in mutation rate both on human and primate lineages or presence of technical artefacts. In order to rule out the last possibility, I constructed a standard pipeline to process genomic data to interpret results in light of other factors impacting Mutation rate. <br> <br>
