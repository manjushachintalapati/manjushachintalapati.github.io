<h3>Genomic variation affecting genomic human diversity</h3>

My graduate work focused on non-SNP variation in humans which affect larger part of the genome compared to SNPs and cause loss of function or genomic duplications. My work on [indels on the human lineage](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-1018-8) identified 2X occurrence of deletions compared to insertions with higher deleterious effects. Indels segregating in humans, specifically non-Africans introduced due to introgression from Neanderthal admixture have undergone selection either before or after admixture. Functional analysis suggested introgressed indels linked to phenotypes such as Menarche in humans.

<h3> Evolutionary forces shaping diversity in humans </h3>
Mutations and recombinations are two major molecular processes impacting the human genome diversity. Inference and understating the these processes is essential for better understanding of variation in the human genome . Moreover, these rates can use as a clock to measure the time elapsed since an event has occurred helping us reconstruct events of the past. 

We developed [DATES](https://elifesciences.org/articles/77625) which uses recombination rate as a clock to date admixture times. DATES is a single sample statistic applicable to both present day and ancient degraded genomes. Applying DATES to European genomes helped infer the timing of formation of ancient Anatolian farmers and Steppe pastoralists, two of the major ancestral populations contributing ancestry to most present-day Europeans. The method is freely available here, [DATES_v4010](https://github.com/manjushachintalapati/DATES_v4010). 
Study of mutation rates across the primate tree including the humans, great apes, new world and old world monkeys using published studies reveal interesting patters such as 4 fold variation in the mutation rate across the phylogenetic tree. In our published [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X20300794), we show discrepancies between the genetic and fossil evidence changes our understanding of human evolution. Potential explanations of this effect could be either due to life history traits, slowdown in mutation rate both on human and primate lineages or presence of technical artefacts. In order to rule out the last possibility, we constructed a standard pipeline to process genomic data to enable the interpretation of results in light of other factors impacting Mutation rate. <br> <br>
